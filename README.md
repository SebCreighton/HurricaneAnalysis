# Hurricane Analysis

This CodeAcademy project organises and manipulates data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed.  The projected occured as this:
- To begin, the damages list was updated to convert prefix values to floats and kept "Damages not Recorded".
- With the new damages list and all other lists, a dictionary was constructed where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data (Name, Month, Year,Max Sustained Wind, Areas Affected, Damage, Death) about the hurricane.
- Convert the current dictionary of hurricanes to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year.
- Determine how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane.
- Find the area affected by most hurricanes, and how often hit.
- Find the hurricane causing most deaths, and how many it caused.
- Rate hurricanes on mortality scale according to the ratings provided, with key being rating and value being upper bound of deaths with that rating.
- Find hurricane causing greatest damage, and how costly it was.
- Rate hurricanes on damage scale according to the ratings provided, with key being rating and value being upper bound of damage for that rating.
